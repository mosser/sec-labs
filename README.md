### Deliveries

  - Week 43:
    - A file named `ArduinoML-lastname1-lastname2.tar.gz` containing:
      - The code of the implemented steps (in separated sub-directories);
      - A `Readme.md` file with answers to the steps feedback questions
    - The selected papers for the review assignment (individual).

  - Week 51: A file named `SSL-lastname1-lastname2.tar.gz` containing:
      - The code of the DSL defined in the project;
      - Examples that uses the DSL to address the challenges of the project;
      - A report `lastname1-lastname2.pdf` describing the abstract syntax of the language, your design choices, and the strengths and weaknesses of the language.
      
  - Week 2: (10.01.18, 23h59)
